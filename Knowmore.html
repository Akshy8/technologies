  <h1 class="lead"> *React JS</h1>
  <p>React is known as a remarkably flexible library. Once you understand the concepts of react, you can use it on a vast variety of application platforms to build the great quality of user interfaces. React is known as Library it is not a framework. 
    React provides great developer experience. ReactJS APIs are easy to understand. React uses HTML inside JavaScript which is known as JSX. Here you can play with HTML as well as JavaScript.  
    React has Facebook’s support, as it is widely used in Facebook app, websites and in Instagram. 
    The topmost contributors on GitHub are employees of Facebook. Also React.org provides a set of blogs which gives the detailed explanation of each topic of react JS. </p>

       <h2 class="lead"> *Angular </h2>
        <p>Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Angular’s primary purpose is to develop single-page applications because of this feature it got spread widely all over the world. 
        Another main reason for the popularity of Angular is the Front-end Development. To gain attraction we should have web and mobile applications in a very attractive manner, this can be done using angular JS. Company websites like PayPal, Netflix, Google, Virgin America and many more are built using Angular. 
        Angular provides, databinding, MVC – Model View Controller design pattern, dependency injection and cross platform support. 
        Also, Angular is very easy to learn and implement. Since it is an open-source framework the affordability of angular is cost free. 
        Angular JS provides completely declarative UI expressions so, it can provide the structured and understandable components to manipulate.  </p>
        

         <h3 class="lead"> *Vue JS</h3>
          <P>If you think JavaScript as the English Alphabets, then Vue JS becomes the phrasebook which enables the developer to build effective sentences to communicate with. 
           Vue JS is an open-source framework. As the core layer of the Vue JS is mainly focused on view part of the applications only. 
           Vue JS is like Angular and React JS. The basic idea behind the development of Vue JS is to achieve the best results with minimal effort, so that users can code and build with few lines. 
           The best part is Vue JS does not require deep learning, so it is most beneficial for new programmers. With respect to learning perspective, Vue JS requires only the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is unlike Angular and React as it requires the knowledge of additional programming languages. 
           Vue JS functions are readily accessible, and programmer can easily name the functions as per their requirements. </P>

           <h4 class="lead"> *Next JS</h4>
           <p>Next JS is a flexible framework of React, that gives you readymade building block to create faster web applications. 
            Next JS handles the configurations and tooling which are needed for React and provides additional structure and optimization for your applications. 
            No matter if you are an individual developer or a team player, you can handle React and Next JS to build highly scalable, dynamic interactive web applications. 
            Next JS provides a framework to structure the application. Where a developer can only have to create a page and link to the component in the header, which avoids large lines of coding. </p>
             
          <h5 class="lead">*Flutter</h5>
          <p>Flutter is an open-source user interface development kit, which has been developed by Google. 
            It is mainly used to develop cross platform applications for iOS, macOS, Linux, Android, Google Fuchsia, Windows and for web forms with single code base. 
            It enables developer to build smooth cross platform mobile application developments. 
            Flutter expands with huge library which makes it possible to build applications without writing large number of codes. Also, there are some several platforms that use Flutter to build application without writing any code.  
            The main business values where flutter can guarantee are, easy testing and debugging, streamlined development speed, provides flexibility to share code between android and iOS also it is cross platform. </p>
           
            <h6 class="lead">*Three JS</h6>
            <p>Three JS is a JavaScript library with cross browser feature. And it is an application programming interface which is used to create and display 3D animated computer graphics in a browser using WebGL. 
              Three JS can run GPU powered games and other graphics-powered apps straight from into the browser. The main advantage of Three JS is, it gives more inbuilt library and APIs for drawing 3D animation in the browser. 
              Also, Three JS stands the 13th most popular framework category in United States. 
              The abstraction of Three JS, helps to make the WebGL development more productive and easier to implement.  
              If you know Three JS, it makes to understand the complex code of WebGL, which means you just need to be able to read someone’s WebGL code and should be able to understand what you read. </p>
